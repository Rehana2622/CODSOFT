Titanic Survival Prediction Project Completed! 

I'm excited to share my latest project with CodSoft: **Titanic Survival Prediction**. 
This project leverages Python's data science libraries to analyze the Titanic dataset and build predictive models.

### Project Highlights:
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Explored and visualized key patterns in the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhanced data features to improve model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning**: Built and evaluated models to predict passenger survival.

### Tools & Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### How to Run:
1. **Open Google Colab** and log in.
2. **Upload Notebook**: Upload the `notebook.ipynb` file.
3. **Run Notebook**: Execute cells using Shift + Enter.

### Dataset Overview:
- Contains passenger info (age, sex, class, fare, survival status, etc.).
- Split into training and test sets for model evaluation.

Thank you, CodSoft, for this learning opportunity. Looking forward to more challenges ahead!
